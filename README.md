# Confidence-Interval
Finding Confidence Interval when standard deviation is known and unknown and finding boxplots of number of samples from the dataset. The dataset is of heights and weights.

When the standard deviation of the population is known, the confidence interval for the population mean ($μ$) can be calculated using the formula:

Confidence Interval
=

Confidence Interval=( 
$xbar −z * σ/sqrt(n)$ , 
$xbar +z * σ/sqrr(n)$

Where:

* xbar*- is the sample mean,
* σ*- is the population standard deviation,
* n * - is the sample size,
* z * - is the z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level.
The z-score can be obtained from the standard normal distribution table or calculated using statistical software.
