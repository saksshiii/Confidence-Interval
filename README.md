# Confidence-Interval
Finding Confidence Interval when standard deviation is known and unknown and finding boxplots of number of samples from the dataset. The dataset is of heights and weights.

* When the standard deviation of the population is known, the confidence interval for the population mean ($μ$) can be calculated using the formula:




Confidence Interval=( 
$mean −z * σ/sqrt(n)$ , 
$mean +z * σ/sqrr(n)$

Where:

* mean - is the population mean,
* σ - is the population standard deviation,
* n  - is the sample size,
* z  - is the z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level.
The z-score can be obtained from the standard normal distribution table or calculated using statistical software.

* When the standard deviation of the population is unknown, the confidence interval for the population mean ($μ$) can be calculated using the sample standard deviation (s) as an estimate for $σ$. This is done using the t-distribution instead of the normal distribution. The formula for the confidence interval is:
* 
Confidence Interval=( mean − t*(s)/sqrt(n), mean + t*(s)/sqrt(n))

Where:

* mean - is the sample mean,
* s - is the sample standard deviation,
* n - is the sample size,
* t - is the t-score corresponding to the desired confidence level and degrees of freedom.
The value of t can be obtained from the t-distribution table or calculated using statistical software.
